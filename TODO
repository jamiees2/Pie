 TODO:

	- Serialization.
	- Unit tests for Geometry classes.
	- Base converting for BigIntegers.
	- Better DivisorSum (use primes).
	- Integer partitions.
	- Add more unit tests.


 MAYBE:
 
	- Cycle detection.
	- Add arithmetic overflow checks.

PieConsole:
	1. Automatic conversion
		Being able to do something like:
			int width = PieConsole.Read<int>();

	2. Easy comprehension
		Being able to do:
			string width = PieConsole.Read("Width: ");
		instead of the other complicated stuff.

	3. Instead of outputting strings with tons of +'s
		then something like:
			PieConsole.WriteF("My {0} awesome output", "really");

Other:
	- Date algorithm with constellations.
	- File Reading and String Work simplification.
	- Add an option for spaces inbetween chars in CharSymbols.
